Can you write a program to blink 3 leds?
Can you make it blink 5 LEDs now?
I want to add a 50 pixel neopixel strip, can you add that and make it have neat effects?
Can you add 3 servos please?
Can you add a rotary encoder that helps me adjust teh speed of the Neopixel effects?
I want 2 rotary encoders actaully.  One to control the neopixels, and the other for the LEDs, can you do that please?
Wait, let just go back to the first program you wrote.
What is the least lines of code you could write this in?
